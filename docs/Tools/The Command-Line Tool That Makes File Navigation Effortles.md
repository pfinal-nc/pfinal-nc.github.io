# Broot: The File Navigation Powerhouse Inside Your Terminal

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pfinal-nc/iGallery/master/blog/202510150933205.png)

Every time I dive into nested directories with `cd`, I feel like I‚Äôm wandering through a labyrinth looking for an exit. When a project has seven or eight levels of folders, finding one file can make you question your career choices. The `tree` command helps visualize the structure, but the endless scrolling text quickly becomes visual noise.

Then I discovered **Broot**, and it completely changed how I navigate files in the terminal.

---

## What Is Broot?

Simply put, Broot is a terminal-based file manager written in Rust. It displays your directories as an interactive tree, letting you browse and search simultaneously. It‚Äôs ridiculously fast‚Äîeven huge directories open instantly.

### What Can It Do?

**It‚Äôs blazingly fast**

I tested it on a project with tens of thousands of files‚ÄîBroot opened it instantly. Complex folder trees that would make `tree` stutter appear in Broot without delay.

**Smart search**

You can use fuzzy search (just type a few letters), regular expressions (for the perfectionists), or even search file contents. Finding a file becomes a matter of seconds.

**Clean, readable interface**

The tree view makes your directory structure crystal clear. You always know exactly where you are‚Äîno more running `pwd` to double-check.

**Built-in file preview**

Select a file and hit a shortcut to preview it‚Äîwith syntax highlighting for code. No need to open your editor just to peek inside.

**Batch file operations**

Copy, move, and delete files directly inside Broot‚Äîno more mile-long shell commands.

**Dual-panel mode**

It‚Äôs like a modern-day Total Commander. Two panels, side by side. Moving files feels natural and efficient.

**Git integration**

This one‚Äôs a gem. You can instantly see which files were modified, added, or deleted‚Äîperfect for reviewing before a commit.

**Cross-platform support**

Broot works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Whatever system you‚Äôre using, it has you covered.

**Fully customizable**

You can configure key bindings, colors, and commands. I‚Äôve remapped mine to fit my workflow perfectly.

## Installation

Depending on your system, installation is simple:

**If you have Rust installed:**

```bash
cargo install broot
```

**macOS users:**

```bash
brew install broot
```

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt install broot
```

**Other Linux distributions:**

Download the precompiled binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Canop/broot/releases).

### First-time setup

The first time you run `broot`, it‚Äôll ask whether to install a shell function‚Äî**say yes**. This enables seamless integration with your terminal.

You‚Äôll usually add something like this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.config/broot/launcher/bash/br
```

Then restart your terminal or reload the config file.

---

## Basic Usage

### Launching

Once configured, just type:

```bash
br
```

### Navigation

You‚Äôll see a tree view of your current directory.

* Move with arrow keys or `h/j/k/l` (Vim users rejoice)
* `Enter` to enter a directory
* `Esc` or `Backspace` to go up a level
* `Ctrl + ‚Üë/‚Üì` to jump between directory levels quickly

### Searching

Type directly in the input bar to start searching.

* Fuzzy search: just type part of the name
* Regex search: use patterns like `/\.md$/` for Markdown files
* Content search: prefix with `c/`

### File preview

Select a file and press `Ctrl + ‚Üí` for an instant preview with syntax highlighting.

---

## Common Commands

Use `:` to enter commands at the bottom.

* `:q` ‚Äî quit
* `:h` ‚Äî show/hide hidden files
* `:size` ‚Äî show file sizes
* `:dates` ‚Äî show modification dates
* `:git_status` ‚Äî show Git status
* `:cp` ‚Äî copy
* `:mv` ‚Äî move
* `:rm` ‚Äî delete (careful!)
* `:mkdir` ‚Äî create directory

Example: select a file, type `:cp`, and specify a destination path to copy.

---

## Advanced Tricks

### Dual-panel mode

Press `Ctrl + ‚Üí` to open a second panel.

* Switch panels: `Ctrl + ‚Üê/‚Üí`
* Move files between panels
* Close current panel: `Ctrl + w`

Perfect for organizing files‚Äîsource on the left, destination on the right.

### Sorting

Need to find the largest or newest files?

* `:sort_by_size` ‚Äî by size
* `:sort_by_date` ‚Äî by date
* `:sort_by_name` ‚Äî by name

Great for cleaning up disk space.

### Disk usage

`:sizes` visualizes folder sizes‚Äîfar clearer than `du`.

### Run external commands

You can run commands directly from Broot:

```bash
:!cat {file}
:!code {file}
:!vim {file}
```

`{file}` auto-expands to the selected file‚Äôs path.

### Custom configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/broot/conf.hjson`.

Example: add a custom ‚Äúopen in VS Code‚Äù command:

```json
{
  "invocation": "code",
  "execution": "code {file}",
  "leave_broot": false
}
```

### Git integration

Run `:git_status` in a Git repo to view:

* `M` ‚Äî modified
* `A` ‚Äî added
* `D` ‚Äî deleted
* `??` ‚Äî untracked

Instant project overview before committing.

## Handy Tips

### Quick project access

Add an alias in your shell config:

```bash
alias brp='br ~/projects'
```

Now just type `brp` to open your projects folder.

### Integrate with `cd`

If you run `br` (not `broot`), select a directory, and press `Alt + Enter`, your shell will automatically `cd` there. No more climbing directories by hand.

### Filter by file type

Use regex for fast filtering:

* JS files: `/\.js$/`
* Images: `/\.(png|jpg|gif)$/`
* Configs: `/\.config/`

### Disk cleanup

Combine `:sizes` with `:sort_by_size`‚Äîyour biggest folders reveal themselves instantly.

### Set bookmarks

Add shortcuts in the config:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl-p",
  "execution": ":goto ~/projects"
}
```

Press `Ctrl+P` to jump straight to your projects directory.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Searching in large projects

Need to find a component fast?

1. Run `br`
2. Type `header`
3. Use arrow keys to navigate
4. Preview with `Ctrl + ‚Üí`
5. Open with `:code`

Done in seconds.

### Cleaning up `node_modules`

Front-end projects eating disk space?

1. Run `br`
2. Filter `node_modules`
3. Use `:sizes`
4. Delete with `:rm`

Free up gigabytes instantly.

### Reviewing before commit

1. Run `br` inside a repo
2. `:git_status` to view changes
3. Preview modified files
4. Commit confidently

Much better than `git status`.

### Batch operations

While Broot doesn‚Äôt handle bulk renaming directly, you can use `:!` to call your custom scripts for mass processing.

## Tool Comparisons

**vs `ls`:**
`ls` only shows the current folder. Broot visualizes the whole structure interactively.

**vs `tree`:**
`tree` floods your screen with text; Broot folds, filters, and interacts intelligently.

**vs Midnight Commander:**
MC is powerful but clunky. Broot feels modern and lightweight.

**vs GUI file managers:**
GUI tools require a mouse and context switching. Broot keeps you entirely in the terminal, keyboard only‚Äîpure efficiency.

---

## Performance

Written in Rust, Broot is lightning fast:

* Massive directories open instantly
* Minimal memory footprint
* Real-time search feedback
* Handles tens of thousands of files with ease

I benchmarked it on a 50,000+ file project‚Äîindexed in under a second.

---

## Final Thoughts

After using Broot for a few months, there‚Äôs no going back.

Navigating with `cd` and `ls` feels ancient now. I just launch `br`, search, and jump straight where I need to be. For deep project trees, it‚Äôs a lifesaver.

Git integration, dual panels, and real-time previews make it feel like a full IDE inside the terminal. And thanks to Rust, it‚Äôs lightning fast and rock solid.

If you live in the terminal or wrestle with complex directory structures, try Broot. Just don‚Äôt forget to enable the shell integration‚Äîit‚Äôs crucial for the full experience.

Since I installed it, I‚Äôve barely used `cd` at all. üòÑ
