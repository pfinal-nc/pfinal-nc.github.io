# Golang Technical Hub

This is the **PFinalClub Golang Technical Hub**.  
Instead of scattered long-form articles, this page groups the most important Go content by topic so you can:

- Follow a learning path from **foundations to production**
- Quickly locate a **“main article”** for a given problem
- Help search engines understand: **“friday-go.icu is a high-quality Golang technical site”**

## 5. How to Use This Hub

If you are new to this Golang section, a recommended learning path is:

1. **Start with foundations**: error handling, security, and observability  
2. **Pick your web stack**: choose a web framework / GraphQL stack that fits your use case  
3. **Explore AI & RAG**: add intelligent search and knowledge retrieval to your existing systems  
4. **Invest in tooling**: turn your best practices into CLI tools and automation

You can treat this page as the **entry point for all Golang content** on PFinalClub.  
Both search engines and new readers can quickly see the full picture of what you do in the Go ecosystem.
