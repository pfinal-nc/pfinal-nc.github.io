## Background

According to IT Home, Walmart is developing an AI shopping assistant capable of making purchasing decisions autonomously, without human intervention. Hari Vasudev, Walmart’s US store CTO, stated that with intelligent agents similar to OpenAI Operator, it is possible to perform fully automated operations from search to checkout without visiting product pages, which will revolutionize e-commerce. Here is a technical speculation and analysis from a technology perspective.

## 1. Data Collection and Feature Engineering

As one of the world’s largest retailers, Walmart’s data collection and feature engineering system is vast and complex, covering multi-channel, multi-modal, and multi-granularity data flows both online and offline. The following are the speculated technologies used:

### 1. Data Collection Technologies
- **Online Data Collection:** Real-time collection of user clicks, browsing, search, add-to-cart, and payment behaviors on official websites and apps via tracking (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics), log collection (ELK Stack), and user behavior tracking (e.g., Segment, Mixpanel).
- **Offline Data Collection:** POS systems, membership cards, RFID, cameras (computer vision), IoT devices (e.g., smart shelves, electronic price tags), and self-service checkouts collect transaction, movement, product display, and inventory change data in stores.
- **Multi-channel Integration:** Using data middle platforms (e.g., Alibaba DataWorks, Walmart’s self-developed platform) to unify, clean, and merge online and offline data.
### 2. Data Storage and Management
- **Data Lake:** Based on Hadoop, Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake, storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- **Real-time Data Warehouse:** Such as Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, for large-scale real-time data analysis.
- **Feature Store:** Like Feast, Hopsworks, for unified management of offline and online features, supporting feature versioning, metadata management, and efficient retrieval.
### 3. Feature Engineering Technologies
- **Automated Feature Generation and Selection:**
  - Use AutoML tools (e.g., Google AutoML, H2O.ai, Databricks AutoML) to automatically generate and select high-value features.
  - Employ classic feature engineering methods such as feature crossing, binning, normalization, missing value imputation, and outlier detection.
- **Text Feature Processing:**
  - Use pre-trained models like BERT, ERNIE, RoBERTa to vectorize product descriptions, reviews, and extract semantic features.
- **Image Feature Processing:**
  - Use CNN models like ResNet, EfficientNet to extract visual features from product images, aiding product recognition and recommendation.
- **Contextual Feature Enhancement:**
  - Enrich context with time series analysis (e.g., holidays, promotion cycles), geographic clustering (e.g., store hotspots), and weather APIs.
### 4. Data Quality and Governance
- **Data Cleaning:** Use big data frameworks like Spark, Flink for batch or streaming cleaning to remove dirty and duplicate data.
- **Data Consistency and Lineage:** Use data lineage analysis tools (e.g., Apache Atlas, DataHub) to trace feature generation processes, ensuring data traceability and reproducibility.
- **Data Security and Compliance:** Implement hierarchical access control, data desensitization, and compliance auditing to meet GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations.
### 5. Real-time Feature Services
- **Streaming Feature Computation:** Use Flink, Kafka Streams for real-time calculation of latest user behavior features, supporting online recommendation and decision-making.
- **Low-latency Feature Retrieval:** Use high-performance KV storage like Redis, Cassandra for millisecond-level feature queries, meeting high-concurrency business needs.

## 2. Knowledge Graph and Product Ontology

The system likely has a massive product knowledge graph, including:
- Product category taxonomy
- Attribute relationship network
- Brand and quality associations
- Price and value mapping
- User preference models

## 3. Recommendation System and Personalization

Walmart’s recommendation system, as the core engine for improving user experience and conversion rates, typically adopts multi-model fusion and large-scale distributed architecture, combining online and offline data for strong real-time and personalization capabilities. The following are the speculated technologies used:

### 1. Collaborative Filtering
- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - User–Item KNN, ALS (Alternating Least Squares), matrix factorization (SVD, SVD++), Latent Factor Model
- **Large-scale Computation:**
  - Use distributed machine learning frameworks like Spark MLlib, TensorFlow Recommenders for efficient training and inference with billions of users and products
- **Cold Start Optimization:**
  - Combine content features and knowledge graphs to mitigate cold start issues for new users/products
### 2. Content-Based Filtering
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Encode product attributes (category, brand, price, tags) via one-hot, embedding, etc.
  - Extract deep semantic features from product text (title, description, reviews) using NLP models like BERT, ERNIE
  - Extract visual features from product images using CNN models like ResNet, EfficientNet
- **User Profiling:**
  - Build multi-dimensional user interest vectors, dynamically update user preferences
- **Recall and Ranking:**
  - First recall candidate products by content similarity, then refine ranking with user historical behavior
### 3. Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks
- **Deep Collaborative Filtering (DeepCF):**
  - Combine MLP and matrix factorization to capture nonlinear user-product relationships
  - Use deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch for large-scale distributed training
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNN):**
  - Build user-product bipartite graphs, use models like GraphSAGE, GCN, GAT for message passing, mining advanced relationships and social influence
  - Solve cold start, interest migration, and other complex scenarios
- **Multi-task Learning:**
  - Simultaneously optimize CTR, CVR, GMV, etc., to improve overall business value
### 4. Recommendation System Architecture and Engineering Practice
- **Feature Service:**
  - Use Feature Store (e.g., Feast) to manage offline/online features, ensuring feature consistency and low latency
- **Model Serving and Reasoning:**
  - Use TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, ONNX Runtime for high-performance model deployment
  - Support A/B testing, online learning, and model hot updates
- **Real-time Recommendation:**
  - Use streaming computing frameworks like Flink, Kafka Streams for real-time user behavior feature updates, enabling millisecond-level recommendation response
- **Multi-channel Integration:**
  - Integrate online and offline data, supporting personalized recommendations across all channels (e.g., in-store terminals, App, Web)
### 5. Recommendation System Security and Explainability
- **Explainable Recommendation:**
  - Use interpretable AI technologies like LIME, SHAP to improve recommendation transparency
- **Security and Privacy Protection:**
  - Apply differential privacy, federated learning, and other technologies to protect user data security

## 4. Automated Decision-Making Mechanism

On the supply chain side, Walmart achieves intelligent replenishment based on demand forecasting models and inventory warning lines.

### 4.1 Demand Forecasting and Inventory Management

* **Time Series Models:** Prophet, LSTM, Transformer, etc.
* **Safety Stock Calculation:** $SS = z \times \sigma_d \times \sqrt{LT}$
* **Reorder Point Calculation:** $ROP = \mu_d \times LT + SS$

### 4.2 Automated Replenishment Process

1. Monitor real-time inventory
2. Trigger automatically when inventory falls below ROP
3. Consider minimum order quantity, batch discounts, and optimize replenishment quantity
4. Generate and submit purchase orders
